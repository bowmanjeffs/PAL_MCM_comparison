# PAL_MCM_comparison
scripts and data files for PAL MCM comparison project

mcm_pal_parse_data_files.R grids out the data files in mcm_data and pal_data, producing the mcm_comparison_data.txt and pal_comparison_data.txt files.  If you don't want to regrid (takes several hours) you can skip right ahead to mcm_pal_analysis.R which has some initial analysis and plots, some of which is probably really silly.  Haven't looked in there in a while!
